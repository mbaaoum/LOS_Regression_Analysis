# LOS_Regression_Analysis
Patient Length of Stay (LOS) is crucial for assessing emergency department (ED) performance. This study explores the association between LOS and multi-level factors, including patient-, service-, and organization-level influences, aiming to enhance healthcare delivery and patient safety. 


# Design/methodology/approac
 This study uses a retrospective observational design to identify a cohort of patients from arrival to discharge from ED. A year-long data regarding patients flow trhoguh ED were analyzed using analytics techniques and multi-regression models. The response variable was patient LOS, and the independent variables were patient characteristics, service-related factors and organizational variables.

# Findings
 The findings of this study showed that older patients, middle triage and hospitalization were all associated with longer LOS. Service-related factors such as complexity of care provided, initial ward designation and ward transfer had a significant impact as well. Finally, prolonged LOS was associated with a higher ratio of patients per medical doctor and per nurse. In contrast, a higher number of residents in the ED were associated with longer patient LOS.

# Originality/value
 Previous studies on patient LOS have focused on patient-level factors, with little research on service-related factors. This study has addressed that gap by examining the association between LOS and multi-level factors including patient-, service- and organization-level factors. Patient-level factors included demographics, acuity, arrival shift, arrival mode and discharge type. Service-level factors consisted of first ward, ward transfer and complexity of care provided. Organizational factors consisted of three ratios: patients per MD, patients per nurse and patients per resident. The results add to the current understanding of factors that increase patient LOS in EDs and contribute to the body of knowledge on ED performance, operation management and quality of care. The study also provides practical and managerial insights that could be used to improve patient flow in EDs and reduce LOS.
